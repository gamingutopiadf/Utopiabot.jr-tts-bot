Yo mama so stupid, she thought a quarterback was a refund!
Yo mama so lazy, she took a ruler to bed to see how long she slept!
Yo mama so poor, ducks throw bread at her!
Yo mama so fat, when she wears a yellow raincoat, people shout "Taxi!"
Yo mama so old, her birth certificate says "expired"!
Yo mama so slow, it takes her two hours to watch 60 Minutes!
